		Messages are parsed using a generic algorithm, independent of the individual field names.

		No whitespace is allowed between the field name and colon. In the past, differences in the 
		handling of such whitespace have led to security vulnerabilities in request routing and response 
		handling. A server MUST reject, with a response status code of 400 (Bad Request), any received 
		request message that contains whitespace between a header field name and colon. A proxy MUST 
		remove any such whitespace from a response message before forwarding the message downstream.

		A field line value might be preceded and/or followed by optional whitespace (OWS); a single SP 
		preceding the field line value is preferred for consistent readability by humans. The field line 
		value does not include that leading or trailing whitespace: OWS occurring before the first 
		non-whitespace octet of the field line value, or after the last non-whitespace octet of the field 
		line value, is excluded by parsers when extracting the field line value from a field line.
